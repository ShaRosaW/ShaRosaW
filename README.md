### Hi welcome! 👋

I am Sharon Rosa Wijnberg, living in Amsterdam.

Recently I finished the _Full Stack Software Development_ study at Novi Hogeschool.

> Here I learned a great deal of _tools and languages_ such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Git, Java, Spring Boot, Maven, PostgreSQL. Using Webstorm and IntelliJ.

I'm looking for a junior job opportunity to start contributing to projects as part of a team learning from others and sharing my own knowledge as well! 
I am preferably at best in a _front end position_ where my full stack knowledge and communication skills also come in handy and would be able to collaborate on and with the back end side.

>Currently I am learning Sass in Visual Studio Code and have set up a list of new (coding)skills to dive in to! 😃

#### The gist of me:

 👩‍🍳 **_"From recipe developer to software developer!"_** 👩‍💻 

My own company as a _pastry chef_ 🎂 was on hold and unreliable for who knew how long, due to Covid pandemic.

🔳 _Luckily thinking out side of the box is one of my strong suits!_ 🔲

I decided to pursue more out of my skillset such as always wanting to _create and innovate_. 

My vision to _solve problems_ and the need to keep _learning and developing_ turned out to be a perfect match with software development. 
  
💫 How amazing to feel passionate about multiple things in life!
